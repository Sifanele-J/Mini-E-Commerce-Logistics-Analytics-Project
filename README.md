Mini E-Commerce Logistics Analytics Project
By Sifanele Jula - November 2025

An end-to-end logistics analytics project focused on evaluating operational performance across carriers and warehouses. This project includes data cleaning, KPI development, pivot table analysis, visual dashboarding, and a written insights report based on an e-commerce delivery dataset.


Project Overview:

This mini-case replicates a real-world scenario faced by logistics and supply chain analysts:
understanding why on-time delivery performance is below target and identifying whether the root cause lies with carriers, warehouse operations, or internal processes.


The project follows a clear workflow:

Raw data cleaning & preparation

KPI development (Total Orders, OTIF%, Average Delivery Days)

Pivot-based exploratory analysis

Warehouse & carrier performance comparison

Dashboard design and visualization

Insights, conclusions & improvement recommendations


Objectives:

Measure On-Time In-Full (OTIF) delivery performance

Compare delivery speed across carriers

Understand warehouse-level performance differences

Identify operational bottlenecks

Build a clean, professional Excel dashboard


Tools & Skills Used:

Excel Analytics

Pivot Tables

Pivot Charts

KPI Cards

Dashboard design

Conditional formatting

Data cleaning (text functions, date functions, logic checks)

Analytics & Supply Chain Concepts

OTIF measurement

Carrier performance

Warehouse throughput

Delivery lead-time analysis

Root cause diagnosis

 Key Insights:

✔ Overall OTIF: 61.1%, well below industry norms (90–98%)

✔ Average delivery time: ~3 days, consistent across carriers

✔ Warehouse A performs the best (67.5% OTIF, 2.8-day delivery)

✔ Warehouse B & C significantly underperform despite similar delivery speed

✔ Carrier performance drops drastically at Warehouse B & C → suggests internal operational issues, not carrier faults

✔ FedEx is consistently the weakest carrier

✔ Delays likely caused by order processing speed, staging, cut-off times, or dispatch timing
